# AssemblyCollector
Collects assemblies, analyzing `IsPFeatureAttribute`, `IsPFeatureDefinerAttribute`, `ExcludePFeatureAttribute` and their referenced assemblies recursively.

Assemblies are considered as sets of types, they are used as a source for the type collector. The `AssemblyCollector` centralizes cached assemblies and
cached types.

The real collectors are the nested `BinPath` that groups similar assembly assembly configurations accross the multiple `BinPathConfiguration`: the work is
done only once if the configuration has the same `Path`, `DiscoverAssembliesFromPath` and `Assemblies` (this is an optimization for the multi-BinPath mode).

## The nested BinPath
A BinPath is defined by:
- Its `BinPathConfiguration.Path`: the _bin_ of a CKomposable project.
- Its `BinPathConfiguration.Assemblies`: a list of assembly names (can be empty).
- and its `BinPathConfiguration.DiscoverAssembliesFromPath` flag.

This hybrid configuration (explicit `Assemblies` and implicit discovering from `Path` directory content) unifies the
experience between tests and regular run contexts. 

Assemblies are always loaded from the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` in the `AssemblyLoadContext.Default`, there is no sandbox or any
assembly load context involved. This collector works in two exclusive ways:

- Explicit mode (typically in test contexts), when there are at least one configured `Assemblies`. 
  It is an error to:
  - Add an assembly name without its corresponding file `Path/name.dll`.
  - Add an assembly that doesn't exist in the `AppContext.BaseDirectory`.
  - Add an assembly whose last write time in `Path` is newer than the one in `AppContext.BaseDirectory`.
  - Add an engine assembly (any assembly that depends on a engine is an engine).
  - Assembly loading error are errors.

  - Each of these explicitly loaded assemblies are "heads": they will provide their types.

- Discover mode (typically in regular CKomposable application), all files in the `Path` are analyzed.
  - Only "*.dll" files are considered.
  - Only their file name matters: the same assembly file name must be available in the `AppContext.BaseDirectory`.
  - When `Path` is not the `AppContext.BaseDirectory`, the last write time of the `Path`'s file must not be newer than the BaseDirectory's one.
  - Assembly loading error are only warnings, not errors (to ignore any native .dlls that may exist).

PFeatures that are not referenced by any CKEngines are the "heads": only them will provide their types. An edge case is when a folder has
no "user PFeatures", when all the PFeatures are "basic" assemblies or purely "PFeature definer" assemblies.
In this case there is no "head". This is sound, there's nothing to process and can be trivially handled by using the Explicit mode.

## BinPath similarity
Multiple BinPaths can be involved in a CKomposition: more than one application can be CKomposed from the same code base, each of them
based on a subset of the "whole application".

# TypeCache
Assemblies are sets of types but a type is not really contained in one assembly. The transitive closure of what defines a type
spans accross multiple assemblies: base types, interfaces, enums, even parameter types usually come from external (dependent) assemblies.

To be able to reason on type sets, the first step is to consider the assemblies and collect the types they declare, ignoring any _implied_ types.
The assembly itself can alter the types it chooses to expose thanks to assembly attributes like the `[ExcludeCKType]` and `[RegisterCKType]` attributes.

For performance reasons, the initial type set of an assembly is built while the assemblies are recursively discovered. Once the assemblies are
discovered, we have
